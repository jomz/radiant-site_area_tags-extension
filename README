= Site Area Tags

Adds a few Radius tags concerning site "sections" or "area's". These are 100% extracted from the Trike Tags extension:
https://github.com/tricycle/radiant-trike-tags-extension

<r:site_area /> Renders the slug of the top-most parent page which is not the homepage
<r:site_sub_area /> Renders the second level parent page slug

<r:if_same_site_area />     and
<r:if_same_site_sub_area /> Render their contents if the local page context is in the same site
(sub-)area as the global page context
This is typically used inside another tag (like <pre><code><r:children:each></code></pre>) to add
conditional mark-up if the child element is in the current site area.

<r:unless_same_site_sub_area /> and
<r:unless_same_site_sub_area /> are also available
